    Lasagna, also known as lasagne, is a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types, made in very wide, flat sheets. 
    The same-named Italian dish is made of stacked layers of lasagna alternating with fillings such as 
    ragù, béchamel sauce, vegetables, cheeses, and seasonings and spices.
